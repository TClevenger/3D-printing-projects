This bracket was designed to fit a standard 3.5" SATA hard drive into the MSI Wind Box DE200 set-top box.  The slots pick up on two pins in the case and the bracket raises the drive 6mm to mate correctly with the SATA connector.  Some minor wiggling and pushing may be required to seat the drive depending on the tolerance of your 3D printer.  It uses standard 6-32 1/4 or 3/8" screws to attach the drive and an M3 screw (about 4 to 6mm long) to lock the bracket down.

I don't have any other MSI models to test with so I don't know whether it'll fit them.  I printed this with a 0.4mm nozzle on an Ender 3 with 20% infill.  Supports are needed both for the bracket hold-down and for the 'tunnels' that go underneath so the bracket clears the protrusions sticking out of the bottom of the case.

This is my very first FreeCAD project and was done after watching only three YouTube videos.  Please don't download my project file if you want to learn how to do things the right way!  I also had no visual on the original bracket so this is completely from scratch.  Please be patient with my work!
